#Steam API
* How to use?
  This API is one of the most easiest api ever made, you are free to edit it in your way, all you have to do is get your API Key from http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey and paste it in $config array. You can change variables as you want since it's just small script which makes Steam API easy to use. Right now, It only uses GetPlayerSummaries (v002) Module from Steam but might be soon available for other modules aswell. Cheers!
